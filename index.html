                        <p>Hey there! I'm diving into the world of Python programming, and I couldn't be more excited! As a student eager to learn and explore the realm of coding, I've chosen Python as my starting point. It's known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility, making it a fantastic language for someone like me who's just beginning this journey.</p>

                            Current use of AI<br/><br/>
                            AI powered assistance. AI powered assistive technology is used for many kind of services which include AI chatbots for customer service, general purpose like chatGPT and virtual shopping assistance. The AI is used to replace customer services. For example, Amazon customer service will be soon handled by chatbots to speed and help out with the process. This helps to reduce work load and speed up the time needed for consumers to receive help. Another of such use at home as a smart assistant it will help you answer questions that u ask to it some examples of it is Siri and Alexa.<br/><br/>
                            
                            These chatbots use natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms (ML). Natural language processing breaks down human speech into bits to understand what it is given by using processing techniques like Bag-of-words and tokenizations. Then machine learning algorithms then take the information and give the results the person desires. <br/><br/>
                        
                            The limitations of such algorithms are inaccurate results. Inaccurate results can include incorrect and biased results, lack of emotions and limited creativity. Due to the AI using machine learning to process a large amount of data from the internet, some results might be outdated, irrelevant or wrong. The AI chatbot can also give results which might be disturbing or insensitive to the userâ€™s feelings and have limited creativity.

                        <li><strong>Data Loading and Filtering:</strong> The code begins by importing necessary libraries and assumes that a dataframe `df` is already defined. It filters the data for the years 2019 and 2020 and specifically for the 'services' industry.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Duplicate Removal:</strong> Duplicate rows for the year 2019 are removed. This ensures that each data point is unique and contributes to a fair comparison.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Plotting:</strong> The code creates a bar plot using Matplotlib with two sets of bars, one for 2019 and another for 2020, representing retrenchment numbers in the 'services' industry. The bars are aligned at the edge of the x-axis ticks, and different widths are used to separate them visually.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Labeling and Formatting:</strong> x-axis labels are rotated by 30 degrees to prevent overlap and improve readability. Axes labels are set for both x and y axes, providing context to the reader. The plot is given a title, '2019 VS 2020', to clearly convey the purpose of the visualization.</li><br/>
                
                        <li><strong>Legend:</strong> A legend is added to the plot to distinguish between the bars representing 2019 and 2020.</li><br/>
